## Part 2: Count, output, variables (gh repo) challenge

### The Task

1. Create sample terraform code using each of the requirements.
2. Upload to github repo and make sure to create/update README.md file.
3. Code should be simple, tested and working

### Requirements: 

**4.  sample repo - use count - null provider - use count.index (gh repo): once done, save the link**

**5.  sample repo - output (gh repo): once done, save the link**

**6.  sample repo - variables (gh repo): once done, save the link**


The code's purpose is to provision a **VPC, subnet, 2 EC2 instances, security groups** attached to them, and **security group rules**. The *null provider* in this particular case is used to execute command locally which generates a .txt file in the current directory containing the private IP of the second instance. To fulfill the requirements of the task, I have also included *variables, count, count.index* and *output*.
